 * Revision 1.4  2005/06/17 15:20:19  vasilche
 * Changed CGuard<> to store locking and unlocking objects using pair_base_member.
 * Changed Lock::() and Unlock::() to return void because it was not used anyway.

 * Revision 1.3  2004/10/06 16:14:02  kuznets
 * try and ignore exceptions in ~CGuard
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/06/17 19:20:12  vasilche
 * Simplify CGuard code - no exceptions or return values.
